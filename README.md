# About this Repository

## Animation Library

### This repository is a simple animation library I created for various persons upon requests and for the fun of CSS Animations using just pure HTML and CSS.


### Of course, there are tons of it on the internet, but knowing the abiity to do it and create one just like that and the thrills that comes with it is what spurred me on to create this repository.

### I might not be consistent, but I will try creating at least a different animation every week (except when extremely busy, for instance: School or Work[soon])

### If you find this repository helpful, you can star it, follow me and also add to it.
